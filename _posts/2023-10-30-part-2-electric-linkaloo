I'm going to try to _link_ something now.
*WILL IT WORK*? We will see.

Nothing too crazy, we're just going to [link to Google *TM*](https://www.google.com)

Okay. If _that_ worked, we're going to try something else, like the [link to my website](https://www.murrayfarnellvo.com).

Did that work? Hope so!
